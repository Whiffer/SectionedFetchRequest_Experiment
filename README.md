# SectionedFetchRequest_Experiment

Updated: July 16, 2021

I am in the process of creating a companion project to my SwiftUI-Core-Data-Test project that will use the new Property Warappers and Dynamic Properties that were introduced in the WWDC21-10017 session.  I was pretty much done, except that I was having one issue with the new @SectionedFetchRequest Property Wrapper. I have now developed what I think is a suitable workaround for this issue and will now resume working to complete the new sample project.

My issue, and my workaround for it, are documented in the comments in the ContentView of this project. Please let me know if there are any questions or concerns with this experiment with @SectionedFetchRequest.

My instinct is that this issue is an oversight with the implementation of the @SectionedFetchRequest Property Wrapper in the iOS 15 Beta code, however, I am open to alternative interpretations.  I will be submitting a Feedback request to Apple as well.
