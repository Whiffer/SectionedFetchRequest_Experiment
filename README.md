# SectionedFetchRequest_Experiment

Updated: July 11, 2021

I am in the process of updating my SwiftUI-Core-Data-Test project to use the new Dynamic Properties that were introduced in the WWDC21-10017 session.  I'm pretty much done, except that I'm having one issue with the SectionedFetchRequest. This is a sample project that demonstrates the issue that I'm having.  My instinct is that the issue is a minor oversight with the iOS 15 Beta code, however, I am open to alternative interpretations.

My issue is documented in the comments in the ContentView, which includes a hack as a possible workaround.  However, I would prefer a more straight forward solution or answer.
